# COVID-19-Visualization

## Objective Questions 

### 1. Cases Between Countries - Chris

a. Barchart comparing COVID-cases between countries [Death and Confirmed Cases]? - Date April 1st
b. Time series for top 10 affected countries from #1 above. - observe the exponential growth
c. Observe Recovery rate among countries; compare recovery rate with death rate - is there enough reason for alarm? Are there countries we can learn from?

### 2. Within The United States - Ola send pivoted data
Repeat 1 at State Level <br>
a. Barchart comparing COVID-cases between states [Death and Confirmed Cases]? - Date April 1st
b. Time series for top 10 affected countries from #1 above. - observe the exponential growth
c. Observe Recovery rate among countries; compare recovery rate with death rate - is there enough reason for alarm? Are there countries we can learn from? 

### 3. Compare Covid with other diseases? Death total for 2/1/2020 - 3/28/2020 [Chris]
Compare COVID-19 with other causes of death
1. Is there any correlation between the closely related/similar respiratory disease (pneumonia)


### 4 - How are Developing and Developed Countries coping? Ola
a. we need to find a table for classifiying countries into developing/developed
b. t-Test persepective with null hypothesis that developing countries have more cases of the virus than developed. 
run t-test, check p-value and coroborate the hypothesis <br>

In your visualization, compare the data for the US and the rest of the world, as well as the developed and less developed countries. You can supplement the datasets with other datasets. If you do, you must provide reference and source for the dataset.


### Extra: Show progression of COVID as leading cause of death in the United States
Need data

TO DO: <br>
get developed, devolping
barcharts and line graphs
daily-death rate in the US 



### Report 
A. **Intro:** <br>
B. Should COVID-19 be taken seriously? Yes..because of the rapid growth in the number of deaths. <br>
C. What can we do? <br>
    Look at recovery rates and get recommendation from countires with high recovery rates.
    Given the nature of ho the virus spreads, limit travel from or to countries with high number cases. 
    Also within US, place order for people from states with enormously high number of cases in self-quarantine.
